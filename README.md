# NotLost

NotLost is an app I created for personal use during hiking trips. The main idea is to hard-code some coordinates of the hike into the app so the app can read the coordinates and place them in the real world using augmented reality.

* This app is not yet tested in real world so please don't rely on this app to give you 100% accurate directions. 


### Frameworks Used
- ARCL for placing virtual objects into the real world 
- Swift programming language 
- UIKit
